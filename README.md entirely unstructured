# Excel2JSONwebapp_sidelined
It's been a long time since I've coded anything. This was a learning project for me. The basic goal was to see if I still had the logic skills to make anything that even remotely worked. Michael was to take a entirely unstructured Excel spreadsheet with multiple different kinds of data, pick a couple of things, extract them and get them to display in an HTML form and on submit populated table. I did this with Json, some Python scripts with pandas for data cleaning. And some basic HTML5 scripting, I used the HTML5 final API to try to handle right operations but I found that there are data persistence issues with this method. So maybe one day when I have some extra time I will clean up the approach and turn it into a proper database application
